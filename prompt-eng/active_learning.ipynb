    "# Active Learning Prompting in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Active Learning Prompting** is a technique where the AI **asks clarifying questions** before making a decision.  \n",
    "This allows the model to:\n",
    "- **Resolve ambiguities in the input before generating an answer**.  \n",
    "-  **Improve accuracy by gathering missing details**.  \n",
    "- **Dynamically adjust its evaluation based on user feedback**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful for **resume screening**, where job requirements may be unclear or candidates may have **transferable skills** that need further clarification.\n",

    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Better Accuracy** | AI **asks for clarification** before making a decision. |\n",
    "| **Human-AI Collaboration** | AI **engages with the user to refine its understanding**. |\n",
    "| **Reduced Bias** | AI avoids **misinterpreting missing or ambiguous information**. |\n",
    "| **Improved Hiring Decisions** | AI dynamically **adjusts match scores based on additional input**. |\n",

    "## How Active Learning Prompting Works\n",
    "1️⃣ **AI evaluates the initial resume & job description**.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Before scoring, AI asks key clarifying questions** (e.g., \"Is GCP experience mandatory?\").  \n",
    "3️⃣ **User provides additional details**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **AI updates its decision based on the new input**.  \n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with Active Learning**\n",
    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Data Scientist** and requires **Python, SQL, and GCP experience**.  \n",
    "A candidate has **Python and SQL** but lacks **GCP**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Active Learning Prompting**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Ask if GCP is mandatory or if AWS experience is acceptable**.  \n",
    "- **Adjust the match score based on the response**.  \n",
    "- **Provide a refined hiring recommendation**.  \n",
