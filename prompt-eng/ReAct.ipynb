    "# ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Prompting in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ReAct (**Reasoning + Acting**) is a **powerful prompt engineering technique** that allows AI to:\n",
    "✔ **Break down problems into logical steps** (Reasoning).  \n",
    "✔ **Interact with external sources before making decisions** (Acting).  \n",
    "✔ **Dynamically adjust outputs based on retrieved data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method was **introduced by Yao et al. (2022)** and is commonly used in **AI-assisted decision-making**, such as **resume screening, financial modeling, and automated research agents**.\n",

    "## Why Use ReAct Prompting?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Step-by-step reasoning** | Forces AI to **think logically** before answering. |\n",
    "| **Real-world data integration** | AI can **fetch industry benchmarks** (e.g., salary trends, required skills). |\n",
    "| **Better hiring decisions** | AI adjusts **match scores dynamically** based on external insights. |\n",
    "| **More accurate evaluations** | Prevents **bias** by incorporating market trends. |\n",

    "## How ReAct Prompting Works\n",
    "1️⃣ **Extract & Analyze** → Identify **job requirements** and **candidate qualifications**.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Fetch External Data** → Look up **real-world hiring trends** (e.g., salary benchmarks, skill demands).  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Adjust Score Dynamically** → Modify **match score based on data-driven insights**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Make Final Decision** → Provide a **structured hiring recommendation**.\n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with ReAct Prompting**\n",
    "Consider a job listing for a **Cloud Engineer** requiring:\n",
    "- **5+ years in cloud computing**.\n",
    "- **Proficiency in AWS & GCP**.\n",
    "- **A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate named **Jane Doe** has:\n",
    "- **6 years of experience** in cloud computing.\n",
    "- **Proficiency in AWS, GCP, and Azure**.\n",
    "- **A Master’s degree in Computer Science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **ReAct Prompting**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Analyze the resume** to check qualifications.  \n",
    "- **Fetch job market trends** (e.g., demand for AWS vs. GCP).  \n",
    "- *Adjust the match score** based on **industry benchmarks**.  \n",
    "- **Provide a hiring decision** (e.g., \"Highly Recommended\").\n",
