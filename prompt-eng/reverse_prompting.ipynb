    "# Reverse Prompting in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reverse Prompting** is a technique where AI **asks clarifying questions before making a decision**, ensuring that it fully understands the input before providing an answer.  \n",
    "This method helps in:\n",
    "- **Improving accuracy in ambiguous scenarios**.  \n",
    "- **Identifying missing details before making hiring recommendations**.  \n",
    "- **Enhancing collaboration between AI and humans for better decision-making**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of assuming missing information, AI **actively requests additional input** from users before finalizing a hiring decision.\n",

    "## Why Use Reverse Prompting?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Clarifies Ambiguous Inputs** | AI asks questions **before making decisions**. |\n",
    "| **Reduces Incorrect Assumptions** | AI seeks missing details **instead of guessing**. |\n",
    "| **Enhances Human-AI Collaboration** | AI and users work together **to refine hiring evaluations**. |\n",
    "| **Improves Hiring Accuracy** | AI ensures **fair and informed hiring decisions**. |\n",

    "## How Reverse Prompting Works\n",
    "1️⃣ **AI evaluates initial resume & job description**.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Before scoring, AI asks 2-3 clarifying questions** (e.g., “Is cloud experience mandatory?”).  \n",
    "3️⃣ **User provides additional details**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **AI refines its evaluation based on user responses**.  \n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with Reverse Prompting**\n",
    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Machine Learning Engineer** with:\n",
    "- **Experience in Python, TensorFlow, and cloud computing**.\n",
    "- **At least 3 years of experience**.\n",
    "- **A Master’s degree in Computer Science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate has:\n",
    "- **Python & TensorFlow skills**.\n",
    "- **4 years of experience** but **no cloud computing experience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Reverse Prompting**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Ask whether cloud experience is mandatory or flexible**.  \n",
    "- **Adjust the match score based on the response**.  \n",
    "- **Provide a final hiring recommendation with full context**.  \n",
