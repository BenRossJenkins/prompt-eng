    "# **Multi-Level Prompting Experiments for AI Resume Screening**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook explores **multi-level automation in AI resume screening** using **Meta-Prompting** and **Multi-Step Iterative Evaluation**. The objective is to enhance **fairness, accuracy, and structured decision-making** in AI-driven hiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Experimental Setup**\n",
    "The notebook tests **two key multi-level prompt engineering techniques**:\n",
    "1. **Meta-Prompting (Level-1 Automation)** â€“ AI **generates an optimized prompt** before performing resume evaluation.\n",
    "2. **Multi-Step Iterative Resume Evaluation (Level-2 Automation)** â€“ AI **performs multiple evaluation cycles**, refining hiring decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of This Experiment**\n",
    "- **Automated prompt generation**: Meta-Prompting ensures AI **receives structured guidance** before analyzing resumes.\n",
    "- **Iterative resume evaluation**: AI **self-refines decisions** using gap analysis and structured scoring.\n",
    "- **Optimized for performance**: Tests **three models** (Mistral, Llama3, Phi3) and **multiple parameter variations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Optimized Parameters**\n",
    "To ensure **efficiency and reliability**, we use:\n",
    "- **Temperature**: `{0.5, 1.0}` â€“ Testing **low and high randomness**.\n",
    "- **Context Size**: `1024` â€“ Optimized for **processing detailed resumes**.\n",
    "- **Output Length**: `300` tokens â€“ Ensures AI **generates structured recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Expected Insights**\n",
    "- **How does AI-generated prompt quality impact hiring decisions?**\n",
    "- **Can multi-step evaluations improve accuracy over a single-step analysis?**\n",
    "- **Which configurations balance efficiency and hiring decision accuracy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:** Analyze test results to identify **optimal AI resume screening strategies**."
