    "# Self-Reflection Prompting in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Self-Reflection Prompting** is an advanced AI prompting technique that forces the model to:\n",
    "- **Evaluate its own response before finalizing it**.  \n",
    "- **Check for errors, missing details, and biases**.  \n",
    "- **Improve decision accuracy through self-assessment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is **particularly useful in AI-assisted hiring**, where **accuracy and fairness** are crucial in evaluating candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Self-Reflection Prompting?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Error Detection** | AI **double-checks its own evaluation** before returning an answer. |\n",
    "| **Bias Reduction** | Prevents **overweighting or underweighting skills** by forcing a second review. |\n",
    "| **Higher Hiring Accuracy** | Ensures that **all relevant skills and qualifications are considered**. |\n",
    "| **Better Decision-Making** | AI revises its **match score & hiring recommendation if necessary**. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Self-Reflection Prompting Works\n",
    "1️⃣ **Initial Evaluation** → Extract **job requirements**, compare **candidate qualifications**, and assign a **match score**.  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Self-Reflection Check** → AI **reviews its own response** for **missed details or inconsistencies**.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **Re-Evaluation & Adjustments** → If necessary, **recalculate the match score and refine the hiring recommendation**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Final Hiring Decision** → Return a **revised, well-thought-out response** with **improved accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with Self-Reflection**\n",
    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Cloud Engineer** with:\n",
    "- **5+ years of cloud computing experience**.\n",
    "- **Proficiency in AWS & GCP**.\n",
    "- **A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate named **Jane Doe** has:\n",
    "- **6 years of experience** in cloud computing.\n",
    "- **Proficiency in AWS, GCP, and Azure**.\n",
    "- **A Master’s degree in Computer Science**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Self-Reflection Prompting**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Evaluate the resume & assign an initial match score**.  \n",
    "- **Review its own response for accuracy**.  \n",
    "- **Adjust the score if any errors or biases are found**.  \n",
    "- **Return the final hiring recommendation after self-assessment**.\n",
