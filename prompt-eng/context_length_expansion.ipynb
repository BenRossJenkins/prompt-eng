    "# Context-Length Expansion in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context-Length Expansion Prompting** is a technique that helps AI **retain and process larger amounts of contextual information**.  \n",
    "This is particularly useful in:\n",
    "- **Long-form resume screening** (handling detailed job descriptions & multi-page resumes).  \n",
    "- **Analyzing career trajectories over multiple roles & companies**.  \n",
    "- **Maintaining relevant context across multiple interactions** (reducing hallucinations & context loss).  \n",
    "\n",
    "By **expanding the model‚Äôs effective context length**, AI can **deliver more accurate, holistic hiring evaluations**.\n",

    "## üîπ Why Use Context-Length Expansion?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Handles Long Resumes** | AI can process **multi-page resumes & job descriptions** effectively. |\n",
    "| **Improves Memory Retention** | AI **remembers earlier details** in long conversations. |\n",
    "| **Enhances Decision Accuracy** | AI evaluates candidates **holistically across multiple experiences**. |\n",
    "| **Reduces Information Loss** | AI retains **relevant skills & career history** across its reasoning process. |\n",

    "1Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimizing model parameters** (e.g., increasing `num_ctx` to maximize memory).  \n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ **Segmenting and recalling past context** using **adaptive memory techniques**.  \n",
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ensuring long-context consistency** by reinforcing key information throughout the evaluation.  \n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with Context-Length Expansion**\n",
    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Senior Data Scientist** and requires:\n",
    "- **10+ years of experience in analytics, machine learning, and AI**.\n",
    "- **Proven leadership in mentoring junior data scientists**.\n",
    "- **Strong expertise in Python, SQL, and cloud computing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate has:\n",
    "- **15 years of experience across multiple roles**.\n",
    "- **Strong machine learning expertise but limited leadership experience**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Context-Length Expansion**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Process the full career trajectory of the candidate**.  \n",
    "- **Identify key leadership moments from their past roles**.  \n",
    "- **Provide a final evaluation without losing early context**.  "
