    "# Multi-Persona Prompting in AI Resume Screening\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Persona Prompting** is a technique where AI **adopts multiple personas** to simulate **diverse perspectives** in decision-making.  \n",
    "This enables AI to:\n",
    "- **Analyze problems from different viewpoints (e.g., hiring manager, technical lead, HR representative)**.  \n",
    "- **Compare evaluations across multiple roles before making a final decision**.  \n",
    "- **Reduce bias by incorporating multiple hiring priorities**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is particularly useful in **resume screening**, where **technical, cultural, and business considerations** must all be balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Multi-Persona Prompting?\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Simulates Real-World Hiring** | AI evaluates from **hiring manager, HR, and team lead perspectives**. |\n",
    "| **Balanced Decision-Making** | Ensures a **well-rounded hiring decision**. |\n",
    "| **Reduces Bias** | AI considers **technical fit, cultural alignment, and business impact**. |\n",
    "| **Improves Hiring Accuracy** | AI **aggregates multiple persona insights for an optimal recommendation**. |\n",

    "## How Multi-Persona Prompting Works\n",
    "1️⃣ **AI adopts multiple personas** (e.g., hiring manager, technical lead, HR).  \n",
    "2️⃣ **Each persona independently evaluates the candidate** based on their priorities.  \n",
    "3️⃣ **AI aggregates the feedback** and adjusts the **match score dynamically**.  \n",
    "4️⃣ **Final hiring decision is made based on combined insights**.\n",

    "## **Example: AI Resume Screening with Multi-Persona Prompting**\n",
    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Data Scientist** and requires:\n",
    "- **Python, SQL, and GCP experience**.\n",
    "- **Strong problem-solving skills**.\n",
    "- **Cultural fit within a fast-paced startup**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A candidate has:\n",
    "- **Python, SQL, but no GCP experience**.\n",
    "- **Great analytical skills but prefers corporate environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **Multi-Persona Prompting**, AI will:\n",
    "- **Analyze the resume from hiring manager, team lead, and HR perspectives**.  \n",
    "- **Adjust the match score based on all evaluations**.  \n",
    "- **Provide a final hiring recommendation**.  \n",
