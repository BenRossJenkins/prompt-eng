    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tree of Thoughts (ToT) Prompting** is an advanced AI reasoning technique that enhances decision-making by:\n",
    "- **Exploring multiple reasoning paths before finalizing an answer**.  \n",
    "- **Considering diverse perspectives (e.g., hiring manager, team lead, business needs)**.  \n",
    "- **Aggregating insights from different thought processes to make the best decision**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This method **improves AI decision accuracy and reduces bias** in complex evaluations like **hiring decisions, financial forecasting, and strategic planning**.\n",

    "|---------|---------|\n",
    "| **Multi-Perspective Analysis** | AI evaluates decisions from **different viewpoints** before finalizing. |\n",
    "| **Error Reduction** | AI **cross-checks perspectives** to avoid missing important factors. |\n",
    "| **Balanced Decision-Making** | AI considers both **technical fit & long-term impact**. |\n",
    "| **Improved Hiring Accuracy** | AI **ensures structured, unbiased hiring recommendations**. |\n",

    "### **Scenario:**  \n",
    "A company is hiring a **Cloud Engineer** with:\n",
    "- **5+ years of cloud computing experience**.\n",
    "- **Proficiency in AWS & GCP**.\n",
    "- **A Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**.\n",
